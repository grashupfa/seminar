1) Load Python project in the folder "source" into your IDE
2) AALERGIA is started with the file "_init_.py"
3) In the folder "source/csv" are several subfolders:
	+ craps
	  - this is the craps game
	+ channel_analysis_be_max_change_300
	  - this is the channel with 300 traces and where be_max is changed
	+ channel_analysis_be_min_change_300
	  - this is the channel with 300 traces where be_min is changed
	+ channel_analysis_nb_max_change_300
	  - this is the channel with 300 traces where nb_max is changed
4) If you want to generate a PRISM model with AALERGIA, you need to specifiy the folder in the "_init_.py" file under the variable FOLDERNAME
5) You also need to specifiy the Modelname in the folder that you want to load
	+ For example: name of the files are: data_channel_analysis_be_max_change_300.csv, alphabet_channel_analysis_be_max_change_300.csv
	+ the name you have to put then is "channel_analysis_be_max_change_300" -> leave out the prefix alphabet/data and the file ending ".csv"
	+ there is an example in the "_init_.py" file already
6) After running the algorithm, the file "output.prism" is created
7) Load it into Prism model checker 
8) In each subfolder of the model files, you will fined a file called "learned_model.props", which you can load in PRISM for checking the PLTL-properties
--------------
Alternatively, in each subfolder there are the generated Model Files for Prism, so there is no need to run the AALERGIA algorithm. You can load them directly into PRISM
and do some testing on it.
